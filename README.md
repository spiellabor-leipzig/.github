We are a game development club hosted at the "Medienwerkstatt" in Leipzig, Germany. We try to have fun developing, talking and learning about games!

Keep in mind that a lot of our members are really young (startting at 10 y) and just starting their game dev journey, so be nice even if the projects are a bit rough ;)
